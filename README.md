Any data available through the [CLiC web interface](http://clic.bham.ac.uk/) is also available by directly calling the *CLiC API*.
The CLiC API returns a JSON representation of the CLiC data, which means that the data can be retrieved directly using any programming language.
This package offers a set of convenience functions for calling the CLiC API directly from R.

The package is the result of work by the [Centre for Corpus Research](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/corpus/) at the University of Birmingham.
We would be interested to hear about how you use the CLiC API and are always happy to consider CLiC related guest posts for the [CLiC blog](https://blog.bham.ac.uk/clic-dickens/).
To let us know how you are using the CLiC API, to give us feedback, or if you need any help that you cannot find here or through the [CLiC homepage](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/edacs/departments/englishlanguage/research/projects/clic/) you can contact us at [clic@contacts.bham.ac.uk](lic@contacts.bham.ac.uk).
